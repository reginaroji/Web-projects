      <h2>Timeline</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1962</strong> - Born in Melbourne, Australia on February 22th.</li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - Moved with his parents to Queensland. After moving to Queensland, Bob and Lyn Irwin (Steve's parents) started the small Queensland Reptile and Fauna Park, where Steve grew up around crocodiles and other reptiles.</li>
        <li><strong>1991</strong> - Irwin took over the management of the park and then renamed it Australia Zoo</li>
        <li><strong>1996</strong> - Achieved worldwide fame from the television series The Crocodile Hunter, an internationally broadcast wildlife documentary series that he co-hosted with his wife Terri.</li>
        <li><strong>1999</strong> - The couple also hosted the series Croc Files, a children's wildlife documentary television series focusing on crocodiles first aired on cable TV channel Animal Planet.</li>
        <li><strong>2002</strong> - Hosted The Crocodile Hunter Diaries, a spin-off to the original The Crocodile Hunter.</li>
        <li><strong>2006</strong> - While filming a documentary in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, Irwin died after being pierced in the chest by a short-tail stingray. His death became international news and was met with expressions of shock and grief by fans, the media, governments and non-profit organizations. Numerous parks, zoos, and streets, the vessel MY Steve Irwin, and the asteroid 57567 Crikey have been named in his honour. He is survived by Terri and their two children, who continue to operate Australia Zoo.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Irwin was a passionate conservationist and believed in promoting environmentalism by sharing his excitement about the natural world rather than preaching to people. He was concerned with conservation of endangered animals and land clearing leading to loss of habitat. He considered conservation to be the most important part of his work: "I consider myself a wildlife warrior. My mission is to save the world's endangered species." Irwin bought "large tracts of land" in Australia, Vanuatu, Fiji and the United States, which he described as "like national parks" and stressed the importance of people realising that they could each make a difference.</p>
