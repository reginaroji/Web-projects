      <p>Irwin was a passionate conservationist and believed in promoting environmentalism by sharing his excitement about the natural world rather than preaching to people. He was concerned with conservation of endangered animals and land clearing leading to loss of habitat. He considered conservation to be the most important part of his work: <q><em>I consider myself a wildlife warrior. My mission is to save the world's endangered species</em></q>. Irwin bought <q>large tracts of land</q> in Australia, Vanuatu, Fiji and the United States, which he described as <q>like national parks</q> and stressed the importance of people realising that they could each make a difference.</p>
